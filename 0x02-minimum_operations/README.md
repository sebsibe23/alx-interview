# Minimum Operations

This project aims to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to achieve a specific number of characters using only the "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The operations will be performed on a text file containing a single character 'H'.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for calculating the minimum number of operations involves breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution using dynamic programming. Additionally, prime factorization can be used to find the sum of the prime factors of the target number 'n', and greedy algorithms can be employed to choose the best option at each step.

## Concepts Needed

To successfully solve the "Minimum Operations" problem, you should have a good understanding of the following concepts:

- Dynamic Programming: Familiarity with dynamic programming will help in breaking down the problem and finding an optimal solution. You can refer to the [Dynamic Programming (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/) resource for more information.

- Prime Factorization: Understanding how to perform prime factorization is crucial since the problem can be reduced to finding the sum of the prime factors of the target number 'n'. You can learn more about prime factorization from the [Prime Factorization (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/comp-number-theory/v/prime-factorization) resource.

- Code Optimization: Knowing how to optimize code can help in finding the most efficient solution. You can explore techniques for optimizing Python code in the resource [How to optimize Python code](https://stackabuse.com/how-to-optimize-python-code/) to improve the performance of your solution.

- Greedy Algorithms: The problem can also be approached using greedy algorithms, where the best option is chosen at each step. You can refer to the [Greedy Algorithms (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/) resource to learn more about greedy algorithm strategies.

- Basic Python Programming: Proficiency in Python programming is necessary to implement the solution. You should be familiar with concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions. You can refer to the official Python documentation on [Python Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions) for a comprehensive guide.

By studying and understanding these concepts and utilizing the provided resources, you will be well-equipped to tackle the "Minimum Operations" problem effectively. Applying mathematical reasoning and programming skills will help you find the most efficient solution.

## Tasks

### 0. Minimum Operations

**File:** `0-minoperations.py`

In a text file, there is a single character 'H'. The text editor can perform only two operations: "Copy All" and "Paste." The task is to write a method `minOperations(n)` that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly 'n' 'H' characters in the file.

**Prototype:**

```python
def minOperations(n):
```

**Returns:**

- An integer representing the minimum number of operations required.

**Conditions:**

- If 'n' is impossible to achieve, return 0.

**Example:**

```python
n = 9

H => Copy All => Paste => HH => Paste => HHH => Copy All => Paste => HHHHHH => Paste => HHHHHHHHH

Number of operations: 6
```

**Usage:**

```python
minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations

n = 4
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))

n = 12
print("Min # of operations to reach {} char: {}".format(n, minOperations(n)))
```

**Output:**

```
Min # of operations to reach 4 char: 4
Min # of operations to reach 12 char: 7
```

Ensure that your code adheres to the provided specifications and produces the expected results.
