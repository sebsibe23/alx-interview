# Island Perimeter Project

## Overview

The "0x09. Island Perimeter" project involves calculating the perimeter of an island represented in a 2D grid (matrix). This project is designed to enhance your understanding of algorithms, data structures, and logical operations in Python. You will apply these concepts to navigate and analyze a grid to determine the perimeter of the island, focusing on iterative and conditional logic.

## Concepts and Skills Needed

### 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- **Accessing and Iterating:** Learn how to access and iterate over elements in a 2D array.
- **Navigating Adjacent Cells:** Understand how to navigate through adjacent cells both horizontally and vertically.

### Conditional Logic
- **Perimeter Conditions:** Apply conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

### Counting Techniques
- **Edge Counting:** Develop a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Breaking Down the Problem:** Identify land cells and calculate their contribution to the perimeter.

### Python Programming
- **Nested Loops:** Use nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
- **Conditional Statements:** Implement conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.

## Resources

## Requirements

### General
- **Editors:** Allowed editors are `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- **Environment:** All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3).
- **File Format:** All files should end with a new line. The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- **Documentation:** All modules and functions must be documented.
- **PEP 8 Style:** Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7).
- **No Module Imports:** You are not allowed to import any module.
- **Executable Files:** All your files must be executable.

## Project Execution

- **Project Start:** June 24, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Project Deadline:** June 28, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** June 25, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review:** An auto review will be launched at the deadline.

## Approach

To successfully complete this project:
1. **Understand the Grid:** Comprehend how the grid represents the island and water.
2. **Iterate Through the Grid:** Use nested loops to iterate over each cell in the grid.
3. **Apply Conditional Logic:** Determine whether each cell contributes to the island's perimeter based on adjacent cells.
4. **Calculate Perimeter:** Develop an algorithm to count the contributing edges and calculate the total perimeter.
